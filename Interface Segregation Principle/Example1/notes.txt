We are making classes of different products in a work place

We have xerox machine, cannon and a printer.

Xerox implements fax, printer and scanning features.

We can make a single interface that has all methods of fax, printer and scanner.

The other option is to segregate the interfaces on the basis of their functionality.

It will help us to not implement the methods that a class does not use.


#How to see a interface voilates ISP?

We should not make Fat Interfaces i,e with every methods possible

Interfaces with Low Cohesion

Blank methods

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we implement ISP, we giving single reason to change a interface.

It means by implementing ISP we also implement SRP.

SOLID principles work in cohesion to achieve the goal of a well designed software.
